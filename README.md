1. Sales Revenue by Product by Quantity (Stacked Bar Chart)
- Explanation: The bar chart displays the total sales revenue and Quantity sold for each product category. This visualization makes it easy to compare the performance of different product categories at a glance. For example, it shows that "Food and beverages" has the highest sales revenue, followed by "Electronic Accessories" while "Health and Beauty." Had lowest total sales. Electronics accessories has highest quantity sold while health and beauty had lowest quantity sold. This insight helps identify which product lines are the most profitable and which may need further attention or marketing efforts.

2. Total sales and Rating by payment method (Tree Map chart)
- Explanation: The chart illustrates the sales and rating distribution between the three payment method (Cash, Ewallet, credit care), Cash had the highest sales and also the highest rating followed by Ewallet while Credit card had lowest sales and also lowest rating. 

3. Total and Unit price by Branch (Pie Chart)
- Explanation: The chart displays sales and unit price distribution across different Branch. Each branch is color-coded based on the total sales revenue. Branch ‚ÄúC‚Äù which is colored orange has the highest total revenue and also the highest unit price, followed by branch ‚ÄúB‚Äù while branch ‚ÄúA‚Äù had the lowest sales and lowest unit price.

4. Total sales by Month (Line Chart)
- Explanation: The visualizations shows the trend over time in the data, displaying total sales by month. January is the month with the highest sales, followed by March while February had the lowest total revenue.

5. Total sales by City (Map Visualization)
Explanation: The map chart shows the distribution of sales by the city.  Napityjaw had the highest sales, followed by Yangon while Mandaley had lowest sales.

6. Cards
Four cards were used to display the total sales, COGS, Rating and Quantity sold. Quantity sold is 5131, Total Sales is 301.16K, COGS is 286.82K while Rating is 6.28K.

7. Two slicer were used to filter the records.

## Analysis üìâüìà

# A. Using SQL to perform data extraction, transformation and preproessing. The following were performed using SQL:

**SQL Queries and Insights**
1.	Extract All Data: Allows a complete view of the data for subsequent analysis.
2.	Average Purchase by Customer Type and Gender: Shows behavioral differences between customer groups to tailor marketing and loyalty initiatives.
3.	Average Quantity by Product Line: Query to identify high-demand products by setting a threshold on average quantity.
4.	Branch and Rating Distribution: Enables identification of the branch with the highest customer satisfaction ratings.
5.	Identify Highest Unit Price by Product Line:	Query to determine the product line with the highest unit price.

- Data Transformation
1.	Date and Time Standardization:
o	Converted Date and Time columns into a unified timestamp format.
o	Outcome: Created a new column with standardized date-time data for consistent time-based analysis.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
1.	Missing Values:
o	Checked for missing values in critical columns like Quantity, Unit_price, and Total.
o	Outcome: No missing values were found in key columns.
2.	Outliers in Rating:
o	Removed extreme ratings below 2 or above 9.5 to ensure data integrity.
o	Outcome: 71 outlier rows were removed.

# B. Forecasting future sales using time-series analysis in Python

<p align="justify">

**Model: Prophet Model**

Using Prophet, sales was forecasted for 60 days. The model reveals a stable initial period, followed by a peak and drop, potentially due to seasonal demand or events. The script takes historical sales data, preprocesses it for forecasting, and generates predictions for future sales trends.
</p>

# Components:
- Historical Data (black dots): Actual sales from January to March 2019.
- Forecasted Sales (blue line): Predicted sales for April to May 2019.
- Confidence Interval: Range of uncertainty around forecasted sales.

**Chart Interpetation**
Sales Trend: Predicted stable sales initially, followed by a spike and sharp drop, possibly due to seasonal or one-time events

<p align="justify">

*In Conclusion
The overall pattern indicates an initial steady sales trend, followed by a significant upward spike in sales, peaking, and then a sharp drop. This could represent a seasonal effect, a campaign, or a one-time event driving sales up before a decline.* ‚è¨

## Summary
<p align="justify">
The project focused on analyzing and forecasting sales data to uncover critical trends, customer behaviors, and product performance while identifying opportunities for business growth. Leveraging SQL for data extraction and transformation, Tableau for visual insights, and Python (Prophet Model) for sales forecasting, the project delivered actionable insights into sales trends, product demand, and customer satisfaction. Key analyses included customer demographics, branch performance, payment preferences, and product-line revenue contributions.

- **Sales Analysis**: The project identified seasonal sales patterns, with January being the peak month and February the lowest-performing. High-demand product lines such as Food and Beverages drive revenue, while Fashion Accessories exhibit higher customer satisfaction.
- **Customer Behavior**: Female members contribute significantly to revenue, and cash remains the dominant payment method.
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: The Prophet model provided reliable short-term sales forecasts, predicting a stable trend with occasional spikes.
</p>

## Recommendations
<p align="justify">
  
1. **Sales and Marketing**:
- Increase marketing efforts during high-demand months, particularly January, to capitalize on seasonal sales trends.
- Focus on promoting profitable product lines like Food and Beverages while strategizing improvements for lower-margin items.
